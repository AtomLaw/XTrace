Advanced Programming in Scala: Programming Design Patterns for the Web
Table of Contents for APress Book Proposal

Chapter One: Motivation and background

    * Where are we and why are we here?

          o The concurrency squeeze: from the hardware up, from the web down, applications must be parallel, concurrent and distributed

          o Advances in functional programming, monads and the awkward squad
          o Ubiquity of robust, high-performance virtual machines

    * Where are we heading?
          o A functional web
          o DSL-based design

    * How are we going to get there?
          o Leading by example: a web application for storing and retrieving programs in a toy DSL (or... how Mozilla ought to have done bespin's backend)

Chapter Two: Our toolbox

    * Introduction to notation and terminology

    * Introduction to our core design patterns

    * Variations in presentation

Chapter Three: An I/O-monad for http-streams

    * Code first, questions later

    * Synchrony, asynchrony and buffering

    * State, statelessness and continuations

Chapter Four: Parsing requests, monadically

    * Obligatory parsing monad

    * Your parser combinators are showing

    * EBNF and why higher levels of abstraction are better

Chapter Five: The domain model as an abstract syntax

    * Our application domain model

    * Our abstract syntax

    * A transform pipeline

Chapter Six: Zippers and contexts and URIs, oh my!

    * Zippers are not just for Bruno anymore

    * Constructing contexts and zippers from data types

    * Mapping URIs to zipper-based paths and back

Chapter Seven:  A review of collections as monads

    * Monad as container

    * Monads and take-out (when there is a co-monad)

Chapter Eight: Domain model, storage and state

    * Mapping our domain model to storage

    * Storage and language-integrated query

    * Continuations revisited

Chapter Nine: Putting it all together

    * Our web application end to end
    * Deploying our application on Stax
          o Why we are not deploying on GAE

    * From one web application to a web framework 

Chapter Ten: A semantic web

    * How our web framework enables different kinds of application queries
    * Searching for programs
