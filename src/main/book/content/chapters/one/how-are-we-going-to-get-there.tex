\section{How are we going to get there}

\subsection{Leading by example}

The principal technique throughout this book is leading by
example. What this means in this case is that the ideas are presented
primarily in terms of a coherent collection of examples that work
together to do something. Namely, these examples function together to
provide a prototypical web-based application with a feature set that
resonates with what application developers are building today and
contemplating building tomorrow.

Let's illustrate this in more detail by telling a story. We imagine a
cloud-based editor for a simple programming language, not unlike
Mozilla's ... . A user can register with the service and then create
an application project which allows them 
\begin{list}
\item to write code in a structured editor that understands the
  language;
\item manage files in the application project;
\item compile the application;
\item run the application
\end{list}
